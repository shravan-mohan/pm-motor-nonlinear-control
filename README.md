# Nonlinear control of Permanent Magnet Motors with Actuation Bounds.
This function generates the response time optimal controller parameters for a permanent
magnet motor, resulting in zero torque ripple under no measurement noise. It is assumed, for simplicity,
that the control inputs are the currents instead of voltages. These currents, once known, can be
used to determine the control voltage inputs.
